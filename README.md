# Simple Lift

Create the API and the frontend which implement the behavior of a lift.

Behavior of a lift:

- a lift responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
- a lift has an attribute floor, which describes itâ€™s current location

yarn install
yarn start
```

**Launch webapp (front)**
